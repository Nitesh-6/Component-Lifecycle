      </ul>
      &#160;
      <li>The component lifecycle is divided into three phases: mounting, updating, and unmounting.</li>
      &#160;
      <li>During the mounting phase, the component is created and added to the DOM.</li>
      &#160;
      <li>During the updating phase, the component is re-rendered due to a change in props or state.</li>
      &#160;
      <li>During the unmounting phase, the component is removed from the DOM.</li>
